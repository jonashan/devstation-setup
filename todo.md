- [ ] Fix problem with pipx having to be added to path.
  - Right now I use "pipx unsurepath" but that needs a terminal reload. Instead the path should be set somewhere else.
- [ ] Mise has to install a default ruby version after installation
- [ ] Install Solargraph and Rubocop
- [ ] zlib1g-dev library should be installed before ruby version. Else Solargraph install fails
- [ ] Set background image using scripts
